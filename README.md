## Project Description
**Random Movie Picker** is a simple Flask web application that allows users to randomly pick a movie from a predefined list, as well as add new movies to the list. The app displays a list of movies, lets users randomly select one with the click of a button, and also provides a form to add new movie titles, which will be dynamically updated in the list.

## Features:
- Randomly select a movie from a list.
- Add new movies via a form.
- The app uses Flask for the backend and dynamically updates the page using JavaScript.
- The page is styled with CSS and follows a clean, modern design.
